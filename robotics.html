  My robotics career has been a very important part of my development so far. I
  joined the school's First Tech Challenge robotics team in freshman year, and
  immeadiately became one of the core members, and one of the most active
  members of the team. I lead the construction of the competition robot for all
  3 years, becoming club head in the third year.

  Unfortunately, the pandemic was combined with the founding mentor of the
  robotics team leaving the club, leaving us with a much less experienced mentor
  at a very trying time. This was especially unfortunate, because I had just
  finished my extensive reworking of the teams physical hardware setup, to a new
  parts system. Though we still constructed a robot, we ended up shifting the
  model of the team away from FTC to a smaller scale internal sumobot
  competition. Now, the team seeks to foster the development of robotics skills
  for a wider school audience, and I have begun teaching CAD and other robotics
  skills to members of the new team.
