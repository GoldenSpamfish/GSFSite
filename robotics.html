  My robotics career has been very rocky. My school severly lacked organization
  for their First Tech Challenge robotics team. When I joined it in freshman
  year, I was already one of the most competent members, effectively becoming
  the club head the next year and the actual club head the year after that. Over
  those 2 years, I lead the construction of these 2 robots (though I was also
  the only person who knew how to build them)

  Unfortunately, the pandemic was combined with the founding mentor of the
  robotics team leaving the club, leaving us with a much less experienced mentor
  at a very trying time. This was especially unfortunate, because I had just
  finished my extensive reworking of the teams physical hardware setup, to a new
  parts system. Though we still constructed a robot, we ended up shifting the
  model of the team away from FTC to a smaller scale internal sumobot competition.
