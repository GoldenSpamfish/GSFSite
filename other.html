  Though I love larger scale design projects, most of my designs are for smaller
  things that I use often. These are often no less innovative or creative, and I
  am very proud of many of these smaller designs. Unfortunately, these designs
  were not as well documented when I designed them, but I plan on exhibiting as
  many as I can here. The following models are roughly in chronological order
  from newest to oldest.
