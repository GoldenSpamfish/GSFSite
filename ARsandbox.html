  This project actually predates GSF. I worked on it the summer of freshman year
  of highschool, and finished it that winter. It uses a kinect as a 3D sensor,
  and a short throw projector to turn the sand into topology. It was very
  proscessing demanding, so I built a very powerful PC from essentially scraps
  of old PCs on ebay to save costs. I also contructed a very durable and
  portable table for it out of wood. Ideally, this will be displayed in the
  atrium of my school, or donated elsewhere, as they can cost over $14,000 new.
  It is mainly documented on my blog, here:
