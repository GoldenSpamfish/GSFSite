  In the early part of the pandemic, I was one of many Baltimore based 3D printer owners who
  participated in a movement called Makers Unite, with the objective of
  producing face shield parts to hold frontline medical workers over until
  production was ramped up. This project was my response to the COVID pandemic,
  and also in a certian sense the springboard for all of my future projects. It
  was due to the pandemic that I ended up with my main printer, the Prusa Mk3S,
  which has produced nearly everything else I've made since.
