  I dubbed this fish the "spamfish" in 5th grade, after I was inspired to send
  it to a friend a great number of times. In the following years, I have
  incorporated it as a personal symbol. It can be found everywhere from Profile
  pictures PCBs to plushies to 3D models to scratch games.

  This logo was initially made for use on my first PCB, incorporating the ISO
  font often used in silkscreening. It mainly consists of an outline of the
  batfish, which creates a confusing, but also visually interesting profile.

  Over time, I have found that the GSF has become a symbol of my work, and has
  gained its own set of asthetic principles. Orange parts, well rounded edges,
  and diagonal slots have become a staple of GSF designs. The idea of unity for
  my work has made inspiration come more easily, further driving me to develop
  my skills and continue to create more designs to expand the GSF name.
