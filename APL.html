<p class="bodytext p-1">
  I have been working at APL since Summer of 2021. Over my time there so far I
  have worked on designing and developing physical hardware for testing UAV
  swarm development, and algorithms developed by my mentor, Adam Berlier. Along
  with this work, I conducted research on 3D printed airframe materials. Here
  are some of my projects I worked on with this organization, arranged in
  chronological order.

<p class="caption">VTOL concepts</p>
<p class="bodytext p1">
  The first thing I produced for APL was a set of concept designs for a search
  and rescue VTOL drone, which was unfortunately abandoned by the sector.

<p class="caption">Swarm Prototype 1</p>
<p class="bodytext p1">
  When I first caught wind of the idea of a drone swarm project, called "Peuco"
  after a type of colaborative hawk, I quickly made my first model, a swing wing
  drone which could be fit into a tube.

<p class="caption">First stealth drone</p>
<p class="bodytext p1">
  After more information came to light about the project, I decided to make a
  design that played to the stealth demands of a future drone swarm. This model
  featured sharp edges, a unique wing profile, and a shrouded propeller.

<p class="caption">First generation seabat</p>
<p class="bodytext p1">
  As the demands for the project were finally specified, I designed my first UAV
  platform. The seabat (named after the batfish, of course) was a fairly large
  UAV designed to be entirely 3D printed. However, its electronics casing was
  too small, leading to the development of the future version.

  Now featuring a full sized electronics compartment, this version was finally
  ready for 3D printing.

  In order to deploy a prototype swarm, I developed a flywheel powered
  autofeeding launcher.

<p class="caption">Angler: long range tailsitting UAV</p>
<p class="bodytext p1">
  Seeking to simplify the proscess, and produce a more stealthy demonstration
  model, I developed the Angler, the successor to the Seabat. This version was a
  tailsitter, meaning that it took off vertically from its tail.

  After discussing my design ideas with my mentor, I was instructed to create a
  presentation to contain and flesh out my concepts for the future of UAV swarm
  development.

  Continuing on with this track, I delved into research for a while, and
  performed a study on LW-PLA and its properties.

  IEEE conference at Princeton.
