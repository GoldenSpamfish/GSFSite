<p class="bodytext p-1">
  I am incredibly thankful for my setups, both my making setup and my designing
  setup. It is thanks to these luxuries that I am able to make what I do, and I
  am forever greatful for this opportunity. I have made very heavy use of all of
  my equipment, so I have never doubted my continuous investment in expanding
  it.

<p class="caption">making setup</p>
<p class="bodytext p-1">
  This part of my setup began during COVID for mask printing effort, and I have
  held my family's dining room hostage since, gradually building up racks to
  hold an ever growing library of tools and components.

<p class="bodytext p-1">
  My 3D printer, a Prusa I assembled from a kit years ago is the centerpeice of
  my setup for making things. It is reliable to an unbelivable extent, and I
  have grown to love it. It currently approaches 2000 hours of print time, with
  many more awaiting it.
